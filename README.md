##Circus Game

#What is it?
A fun web based game that I developed for fun using HTML5 CANVAS & P5 Processing. I designed some of the vectors myself in Illustrator.

#Why play? 
Because it features Unicorns, rainbows, and the circus. What other reasons could you possibly need?

#Why did you build this?
Because I can and because unicorn circus is awesome!
